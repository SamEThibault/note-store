# Note Store
Flask app used to take and store STEM notes with an embedded code editor.

## Why it is being built
I have not yet found a simple note-taking application that supports code snippets. Since many STEM courses require students to include code in their notes, I have set out to build a simple
app that allows students to do exactly that.

## Requirements for development
- .env file at the project root with a MongoDB `CONNECTION_STRING`
- A Python environment with the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
